Intro
=======

HMMs is the **Hidden Markov Models library** for *Python*. 
It is easy to use, **general purpose** library, implementing all the important submethods, needed for the training, examining and experimenting with the data models.

The effectivness of the computationally expensive parts is powered by *Cython*.

You can build two models:

<dl>
 <dt>Discrete-time Hidden Markov Model</dt>
 <dd>Usually just reffered as the Hidden Markov Model.</dd>

 <dt>Continuous-time Hidden Markov Model</dt> 
 <dd>The variant of the Hidden Markov Model, where the state transition can occure in the continuous time, and that allows random distribution  of the observation times. </dd>
</dl>

Before starting to work, it is recommended to go trough **tutorial with examples**, [the ipython notebook](https://github.com/lopatovsky/CT-HMM/blob/master/hmms.ipynb), covering most of the main usecases.

For **deeper understanding** of the topic you can see the corresponding [diploma thesis](https://github.com/lopatovsky/DP).
Or read the main referenced articles: [Dt-HMM](http://www.ece.ucsb.edu/Faculty/Rabiner/ece259/Reprints/tutorial%20on%20hmm%20and%20applications.pdf), [Ct-HMM](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~lif/nips2015_CTHMM_learning_camera_ready.pdf) .

Requirements
-------------

-  python 3.5
-  libraries: Cython, ipython, matplotlib, notebook, numpy, pandas, scipy,
-  libraries for testing environment: pytest   

Download & Install
-------------------

After installing Numpy and Cython, you can install the package directly from test pypi.

```
(env)$ python -m pip install numpy cython
(env)$ python -m pip install hmms

```
